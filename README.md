This is a implementation of a bayes-classifier for tt-rss.

Intention of this implementation is, to filter new AND interesting feeds based on previously starred items.
The script is based on a former implementation on two threads in the TinyTinyRSS forum 
http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1746 and
http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=317

It's working by now -  until the filtering part.
